				In 2019 I had starting taking software and web development classes at
				<a href="https://www.jccc.edu/" target="blank">Johnson County Community College</a> in Overland Park, KS.  It was one of the best
				decisions I have ever made, because I found that I really enjoyed learning how computer languages work, and I really
				enjoyed being able to create something useful.

			<p>
				I want to continue practicing and expanding my knowledge, and have something to showcase my skills.  This website is
				a portfolio of what I've learned, and it's a lab for me to experiement.
			</p>

			<p>
				I've had a long career working in TV directing local newscasts, round-table discussion shows, lifestyle and political
				affairs programs.  In 2020, I even won an Emmy for a newscast covering tornado damage to a local town.
			</p>

			<p class="clearFloat">
				I wanted to make sure that my skills stayed up-to-date, and with how much TV stations rely on technology, learning how to
				code was the obvious answer.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've challenged myself to make a game using a game frameword called 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaser_(game_framework)" target="blank">Phaser</a>.  I'm not at all a gamer, so 
				this has definitely been a challenge to come up with a game that's challenging and fun to play.
